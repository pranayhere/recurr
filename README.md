## Guide

The library extends Iterator and make use of `hasNext()` and `next()` to get the date for the upcoming events.
```
LocalDateTime today = LocalDateTime.of(2020, 5, 5, 9, 15, 20);
Iterator<LocalDateTime> itr = new RecurrenceIterator("RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=1TH;INTERVAL=2;COUNT=3", today);
while (itr.hasNext()) {  
    LocalDateTime date = itr.next();  
}
```
